# Next.js 15 Hydration Mismatch

This repository demonstrates a common hydration mismatch error in Next.js 15 applications, where data is fetched within a component that is not optimized for server-side rendering (SSR).  The error occurs when the data fetched on the client-side differs from the data rendered on the server-side.  This mismatch can lead to unexpected behavior and visual inconsistencies in your application.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the `/about` page. You should see a hydration mismatch error in your browser's console.

**Cause:** The `fetchData` function in `pages/about.js` fetches data asynchronously. Next.js renders the server-side content with placeholder data.  The client-side rendering then updates the content. If this updating process does not correctly match the server-side render, a hydration mismatch occurs.

**Solution:**  The solution involves correctly handling data fetching using techniques like `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, or ensuring client-side data fetching does not cause rendering inconsistencies.  See the `solution` branch for a possible fix.
